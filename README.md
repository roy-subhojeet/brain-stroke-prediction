# PROBLEM STATEMENT
"Given the demographics and health-related factors such as age, gender, smoking status, hypertension, and diabetes, can we predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke in the next five years?"
## ❖ BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
- Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so it and its brain cells die. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious, long-term disability, with an estimated cost of $34 billion annually.
- According to American Stroke Association (ASA) about 80% of strokes are preventable. This begs a question “How can people know if they are at risk?”, and “Does Data Science present us with an opportunity to build a data product that has answers?” Therefore, the objective of this project is to find out the likelihood of an individual having a stroke given his demographic and health background.

  
## ❖ PROJECT POTENTIAL
- Self-Awareness at home: As human beings, we are bound by daily responsibilities that forbid us from taking care of ourselves and ignoring our own health. There’s a reason why we say, “Prevention is better than cure” and this project could help identify an individual, given their current information what is the likelihood of them having a stroke. It can be further developed into a project where an individual can determine the risk factors that are contributing to their higher risk of having a stroke and give them feedback on the preventative measures/steps that they should take in avoiding it.
- Research: Our model could be used to generate hypotheses for further research on stroke risk factors and indicators i.e., the features of the model e.g., smoking status, blood sugar level, etc., leading to a better understanding of stroke occurrence and prediction.
- Improved patient care: By identifying individuals who are at high risk for stroke, healthcare providers can offer targeted interventions, such as lifestyle modifications, medication management, and other preventive measures, to reduce the risk of stroke occurrence and improve patient outcomes.


## ❖ WHY IT’S CRUCIAL?
We know that 80% of strokes are preventable. Overall, the potential of this project can contribute to building data products for users that help them identify their risk of having a stroke in near future and provide them with necessary preventative measures they can take, help advance stroke research, and curate better-informed public health policies. This project is therefore crucial to exploring these potentials, and more importantly, presents us with an opportunity to help save lives.
